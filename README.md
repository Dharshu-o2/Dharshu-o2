# üìé About Me:
Hi, I'm Dharshan, a B.E. student specializing in Electronics and Communication at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology. I have a deep passion for electronics, electricals, and technology, which has guided my academic and project pursuits. My journey in technology started early during my schooling at St. Joseph Mat. Hr. Sec School, where I first explored innovative ideas and solutions.<br><br>**Academic & Project Highlights**<br>During my 10th standard, I secured a win in a school competition with my project on LiFi (Light Fidelity) using Arduino. This early success inspired me to further develop the LiFi project, which later earned accolades in two college competitions. In 12th grade, I led by a team that developed an electric vehicle powered by batteries and controllable via a smartphone, winning first place among six competing colleges. My hands-on experience extends across various technical areas, including Python, HTML, C/C++, Arduino, and ESP platforms.<br><br>**Leadership & Future Goals**<br>I have also had the honor of serving as the secretary for the Computer Science subject in my 11th standard, an experience that honed my leadership and organizational skills. Currently, I am focusing on advancing my LiFi project while collaborating with fellow enthusiasts on an innovative car project. My aspiration is to bridge cutting-edge technology with sustainable practices, ultimately making a meaningful contribution to the field of Electronics and Communication.
